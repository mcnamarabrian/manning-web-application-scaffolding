# Project 1 Milestone

I found this to be a tougher assignment than expected. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out the best way to test the code - it's a struggle - and I didn't appreciate the reason behind creating a `FlagSet`.

## Working with the Code

The code used in this project is the solution provided by the LiveLesson.

### Testing the Application

```bash
go test -v
```

### Building the Application

```bash
go build -o scaffold-gen main.go
```

### Getting Help

```bash
./scaffold-gen [-h|-help|--help]
```
